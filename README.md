## Design Philosophy

The site features a **sixties pop art aesthetic** inspired by Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol:

- Bold, vibrant color palette (hot pinks, electric blues, bright yellows)
- High-contrast typography for impact and readability
- Graphic design elements balancing energy with professionalism
- Accessible color combinations meeting WCAG AA standards

This visual approach makes academic content feel contemporary and engaging while maintaining scholarly credibility.
