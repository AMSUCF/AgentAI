# Agentic AI: Autonomous Systems and Subagent Architectures

## Understanding Agentic AI and Subagents

This workshop examines how agentic artificial intelligence and subagent architectures affect workflows in academic research, teaching, and digital project development.

### Learning Objectives

Participants in this session will examine:

- **Agentic AI and subagent architectures** - Autonomous AI systems capable of planning, executing, and managing complex multi-step tasks
- **Perplexity's Comet browser** - AI-assisted web-based workflows for research and teaching tasks
- **Claude Code for web development** - Rapid prototyping of interactive digital projects using subagent architectures

### Workshop Structure

**Three Core Sections:**

1. **Agentic AI & Subagent Architectures** - Examining the structure and capabilities of autonomous AI systems
2. **Perplexity Comet Browser Demonstrations** - Browser-based AI assistance for markdown downloads, BibTeX management, and Canvas LMS editing
3. **Claude Code for Web Development** - Building an interactive p5.js application demonstrating agentic AI concepts using subagents and dangerously-skip-permissions mode

### Target Audience

This workshop is designed for:

- Humanities faculty and graduate students
- Researchers examining AI applications in academic contexts
- Digital humanities practitioners
- Developers interested in AI-assisted prototyping workflows

Technical prerequisites: None. Demonstrations will include advanced development workflows that may be of particular interest to participants with programming experience.

### What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI systems differ from conversational AI interfaces in their capacity for autonomous operation. These systems can:

- **Plan and execute** multi-step tasks with reduced supervision requirements
- **Deploy specialized subagents** that handle specific aspects of complex work
- **Maintain context** across extended interactions and project lifecycles
- **Use tools dynamically** including code execution, web browsing, and file manipulation
- **Self-correct and iterate** based on intermediate results and feedback

This development suggests a shift in AI interaction paradigms, from conversational interfaces to systems with greater operational autonomy.

### What are Subagents?

Subagents are specialized AI agents that operate within a larger agentic system:

- Each subagent has specific expertise (e.g., vision analysis, web development, accessibility auditing)
- They work in parallel to handle different aspects of complex tasks
- The main agent orchestrates subagent activities and synthesizes their outputs
- This architecture enables problem decomposition and specialized task handling

**Example:** When building a web gallery, vision subagents analyze images, development subagents write code, and accessibility subagents ensure compliance - all coordinated by a main orchestrating agent.
