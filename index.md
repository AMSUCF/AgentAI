# AgentAI Workshop

## Agentic AI for Humanities Research and Pedagogy

Welcome to the **AgentAI Workshop** - a hands-on introduction to agentic artificial intelligence tools designed specifically for humanities scholars, graduate students, and faculty.

### What You'll Learn

In this one-hour workshop, you'll discover how AI agents can transform your research and teaching workflows by:

- Processing and analyzing humanities datasets with citation-ready outputs
- Automating repetitive scholarly tasks while maintaining academic rigor
- Building accessible digital projects without coding experience
- Creating custom AI agents tailored to your specific research needs

### Workshop Features

**Four Practical Demonstrations:**

1. **Extended Data Analysis** - Transform raw humanities data into publication-ready documents
2. **Browser-Based AI Assistance** - Integrate AI seamlessly into your existing workflows
3. **Image Processing & Web Development** - Create accessible digital exhibits and galleries
4. **Custom Accessibility Auditing** - Build specialized agents for your digital projects

### Why Agentic AI?

Unlike conventional chatbots that require constant prompting, **agentic AI systems** operate with greater autonomy. They can:

- Plan and execute multi-step tasks independently
- Use specialized tools and sub-agents for complex work
- Maintain context across extended interactions
- Generate outputs that conform to disciplinary standards

This represents a fundamental shift from AI as conversational partner to AI as collaborative research assistant.

### Workshop Philosophy

We balance **visual energy with academic credibility**, creating an engaging learning environment that respects the seriousness of humanities scholarship while celebrating the creative possibilities of new technologies.

Our approach emphasizes:

- Critical engagement with AI tools and their limitations
- Transparency about AI use in research and pedagogy
- Accessibility and equity in digital scholarship
- Practical applications grounded in real scholarly workflows
