# Agentic AI: Transforming Academic Workflows with Intelligent Automation

## Understanding Agentic AI and Subagents

Welcome to this **hands-on talk** exploring how agentic artificial intelligence and subagent architectures are revolutionizing academic research, teaching, and digital project development.

### What You'll Learn

In this session, you'll discover:

- **What agentic AI and subagents are** - Understanding autonomous AI systems that can plan, execute, and manage complex multi-step tasks
- **How Perplexity's Comet browser** transforms web-based workflows with AI assistance
- **How Claude Code for the web** enables rapid development of interactive digital projects using subagent architectures

### Talk Features

**Three Core Topics:**

1. **Agentic AI & Subagents Explained** - Understand the architecture and capabilities of autonomous AI systems
2. **Perplexity Comet Browser Demos** - See AI-powered browser assistance for markdown downloads, BibTeX management, and Canvas LMS editing
3. **Claude Code for the Web** - Watch a full build of an interactive p5.js arcade game about agentic AI using subagents and --dangerously-skip-permissions

### Who Should Attend?

This talk is designed for:

- Academics and researchers interested in AI-powered automation
- Faculty exploring AI tools for course management and teaching
- Digital humanities practitioners and developers
- Anyone curious about how agentic AI systems work and can be applied to real-world tasks
- Developers interested in rapid prototyping with AI assistance

**No coding experience required** - though some demos will show advanced features for those interested in development workflows.

### What is Agentic AI?

Unlike conventional chatbots that require constant prompting, **agentic AI systems** operate with greater autonomy and intelligence. They can:

- **Plan and execute** multi-step tasks independently without constant supervision
- **Deploy specialized subagents** that handle specific aspects of complex work
- **Maintain context** across extended interactions and project lifecycles
- **Use tools dynamically** - from code execution to web browsing to file manipulation
- **Self-correct and iterate** based on intermediate results and feedback

This represents a fundamental shift from AI as conversational partner to AI as an **autonomous collaborative assistant** capable of handling entire workflows.

### What are Subagents?

**Subagents** are specialized AI agents that operate within a larger agentic system:

- Each subagent has **specific expertise** (e.g., vision analysis, web development, accessibility auditing)
- They work **in parallel** to handle different aspects of complex tasks
- The main agent **orchestrates** subagent activities and synthesizes their outputs
- This architecture enables **scalable, efficient problem-solving** beyond what a single agent can achieve

**Example:** When building a web gallery, vision subagents analyze images, development subagents write code, and accessibility subagents ensure compliance - all coordinated by a main orchestrating agent.
